    %h2 One last thing to do

    .large-11.small-centered.columns
      %p To get started collecting your grocery data, all you need to do now is one of the following:

      %ol
        %li
          %p Set up an auto-forwarder to send all grocery receipt e-mails to your endpoint e-mail above. (If you like to micromanage your technology, you can also just manually forward e-mail your receipts.)
        %li
          %p Simply change your contact e-mail address on the grocery site to the endpoint e-mail. (Don't worry -- we will forward all e-mails from them on to you and won't store anything except for data about your purchases.)

  .row.large-11.small-centered.columns
    %h2 Keep it for your records
